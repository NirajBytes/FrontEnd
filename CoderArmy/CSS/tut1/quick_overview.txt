font shorthand property(HW)

In CSS, the font shorthand property allows you to set multiple font-related properties in a single line. It is highly efficient but follows a strict internal order that must be respected for the browser to parse it correctly.

The Required Order
To use the shorthand, you must follow this sequence:

font-style (optional)

font-variant (optional)

font-weight (optional)

font-size (required)

line-height (optional, preceded by a /)

font-family (required)
