This video provides a detailed explanation of the CSS Box Model and the display property, two fundamental concepts in CSS for controlling webpage layouts.

CSS Box Model (0:50):
The Box Model describes every HTML element as a rectangular box, composed of four layers:

Content (2:51): The innermost layer, holding the actual content (text, images, etc.). Its height and width can be set (2:51).
Padding (7:40): A transparent area surrounding the content, creating space between the content and the border (7:40). It can be applied to all sides or individually (18:44).
Border (4:05): A line that goes around the padding and content. Its width, style (e.g., solid, dotted, dashed), and color can be customized (4:05). A shorthand notation exists for setting all border properties at once (6:20). Borders can also have a border-radius to create rounded corners (23:57).
Margin (8:57): A transparent area outside the border, creating space between elements (8:57). Like padding, it can be applied to all sides or individually (21:03).
The video also demonstrates using the Inspect Tool (15:49) in browser developer tools to visualize the Box Model layers and their applied CSS properties.

display Property (Inline vs. Block Elements) (24:46):
The display property controls how an element is rendered on a webpage, particularly its layout behavior:

Block-level Elements (25:03): These elements (like div, h1-h6, p) take up the full available width and always start on a new line (28:20). They respect height and width properties, as well as top/bottom margin and padding (32:33, 33:34).
Inline Elements (25:20): These elements (like a, span) only take up as much width as their content requires and flow alongside other content on the same line (28:20). They do not respect height and width properties, nor top/bottom margin and padding (33:34, 38:49).
The span tag (26:12) is introduced as an inline element used to select and style a specific portion of text within a larger element.
Universal Selector (*) (29:21): This selector can be used to apply default CSS properties (like margin: 0; padding: 0;) to all elements on a page, overriding browser default styles (29:21).
display: inline, display: block, display: inline-block (39:10):
The display property allows you to change an element's default display behavior (39:10). For example, a block-level element can be made inline, and an inline element can be made block.
display: inline-block (40:35) offers a hybrid behavior, allowing elements to sit side-by-side like inline elements while still respecting height, width, and all margin and padding properties like block-level elements (40:35). This is useful for creating flexible layouts where elements need both inline flow and block-level control.
box-sizing Property (45:03):

box-sizing: content-box (default) (45:03): When height and width are set, they apply only to the content area. Padding and border are added on top of this specified size, increasing the element's total dimensions (45:03).
box-sizing: border-box (45:03): This is the modern standard. When height and width are set, they include the content, padding, and border within those dimensions. This makes layout calculations more intuitive and predictable (45:03).
